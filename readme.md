**Description**

This is a portfolio site for a client's concert lighting design company I'm working on. This is the first client site I have hosted on netlify and deployed through GitHub, which has been tremendous. The site uses a mix of Javascript, jQuery, and CSS to light it up. My main focus was using images that really popped, and I wanted to provide clean, smooth transitions with a very open flow to the page. The image galleries use the jquery poptrox plugin, which has been fun to integrate with my own retooling of it. Form functionality is handily serviced by netlify, so prospective clients are able to submit a form directly from the site to my client, and they are able to attach files with the message too. 

**Tasks**
- [x] Deploy to netlify via GitHub
- [x] Integrate form functionality
- [ ] Pare down site weight using best practices
      - resize images, remove unnecessary code
- [ ] Utilize SEO best practices
- [ ] Run accessibility methods (scoring very poorly on lighthouse)
- [ ] Optimize for mobile (currently only optimized for desktop with limited media queries)
